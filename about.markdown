I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abyaa">Youssef Abyaa</a>, an engineer at the <a href="https://www.liglab.fr/fr">Laboratoire d’Informatique de Grenoble (LIG)</a>. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, as well as a Master's in Cybersecurity from <a href="https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/">Université Grenoble Alpes</a>. My interests span the broad domains of Mathematics and Computer Science, with a particular focus on Information Security. I'm always open to conversations around these fields—whether it's to point out some error/mistake or to dive into a technical discussion. Feel free to reach out at: `abyaa.youssef[at]protonmail.com`.
